# Contentstack Personalize JavaScript SDK

Contentstack Personalize, is the first edge-optimized personalization platform, seamlessly integrated within Contentstack’s Headless CMS.

The Personalize JavaScript SDK allows you to personalize content for your Contentstack-powered digital properties, including fetching variants for the user, triggering events, setting attributes, etc.

## Getting Started

### Node.js

If you have selected Node.js for your project, then use the following command to install Contentstack Personalize.

```
$ npm i @contentstack/personalize-edge-sdk
```

### Browser

You can use `npm i` as shown above, if you're using an NPM based project setup.

## Initializing the SDK

Now that we have installed the SDK, let's initialize the SDK.

Initializing the SDK is an asynchronous task as it involves fetching the manifest. Ideally, this should be done as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```javascript
import Personalize from '@contentstack/personalize-edge-sdk';

let projectUid = 'your-project-uid';

// Using async-await:
const sdk = await Personalize.init(projectUid);
```

You can then fetch the active experiences as follows:

```javascript
const activeExperiences = sdk.getExperiences();
```

Please refer to the [API reference](https://personalize-sdk-docs.contentstackapps.com) for details on how to trigger events, set attributes and more.
